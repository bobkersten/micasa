## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/fellownet/micasa/issues). Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Micasa, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Micasa otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.**
* **If you're reporting that Micasa crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Micasa) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Micasa?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/fellownet/micasa/issues). Create an issue on that repository and include the following details:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Micasa users.
